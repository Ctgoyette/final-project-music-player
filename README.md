# final-project-music-player
1. I will be working by myself for this project

2. For my final project, I am proposing creating my own music player application. The player will have a GUI in which the user's music library will be displayed and allow them to select a songs to play. Once a song is playing, users will be able to perform all basic music player functionality including pausing and playing a song, as well as tracking to a specific time in the song. The GUI will allow users to view their library in several different formats including viewing songs by artist and viewing songs by album. The GUI will also allow users to make their own playlists, add songs to playlists, and add songs to their queue. For some more advanced functionality, the GUI will also create suggested playlists based on the user's interests, and these interests can be updated at any time. Lastly, the GUI will allow users to enter the folder or folders where the program should look for the player's music library. Time permitting, the program may also allow users to specify a music server they have to stream their music from anywhere without having to store the music on their computer (I have a Plex server at home I'm going to attempt to interface with).

3. At the very least I will have to write classes for 'song', 'album', 'artist', 'playlist', and 'queue'. The 'song' class will have methods 'play', 'pause', 'title', 'duration', 'album', 'artist', 'genre', and 'song_count'. The album class will have methods 'songs', 'duration', 'year', 'title', and 'genre'. The 'artist' class will have methods 'albums', 'title', and 'album_count'. The 'playlist' class will have methods 'play', 'shuffle', 'title', 'duration', 'song_count', 'add_song, 'remove_song', 'create', and 'delete'. Finally, the queue class will have methods 'songs', 'song_count', 'add_song', and 'remove_song'.

4. I will need to learn how to create a GUI with python (I'm looking at pygame, kivy, and tkinter) and how to play media with python (I'm planning on using the VLC python module)
5. High Priority: Implement GUI with navigation/selection, implement play/pause, implement track to specific time in song, implement playlists
   Medium Priority: Implement queue, allow user to enter file locations where music is stored, implemented suggested playlists, implement music interests
   Low Priority: Implement ability for users to connect their own music servers to the service
