SUMMARY:

   This program is a music player application that allows the user to browse, play, and manage MP3 files on their computer using a graphical user interface (GUI). The program uses the cross-platform “PyQt5” library to create the GUI for the application. The code also makes use of the “qdarktheme” library to apply a dark color scheme to the GUI, giving the application an aesthetically pleasing look.
   The application has a number of features for browsing and playing music from a music library within the GUI. In the GUI, the user can view their music library by artist, album, or track, and can switch between these views using a dropdown menu. Double-clicking on an artist or album in the artist or album view will open a page with more detailed information about the artist or album, and allow the user to play all of the tracks from that artist or album by double clicking on the desired song. When viewing their library by track, the user can also double click on a specific track to play it. The code uses the tools built into the PyQt5 library to handle playback of audio files. All songs, artists, and albums are stored as an object of either “Song”, “Album”, and “Artist”. To determine the information stored in each object, such as the artist and album information, the “eyed3” library is used to read metadata from each MP3 file in the library.
   In addition to browsing and playing music from the library, the application also allows the user to create and manage playlists. The user can create a new playlists, delete playlists, add tracks to playlsits from their music library, remove tracks, and can play the tracks in a playlist in the order they were added to the playlist. Each playlist is an object of its own class, “Playlist”, and each playlist created is stored in an M3U file, one of the most common playlist file formats. The application also includes a settings page where the user can see the currently added library file locations, and add other file locations to search for music. If the user is on a Windows operating system, when the application is started, the program will automatically search for and load all playlists of filetype M3U and songs of filetype MP3 in “C:\Users\<user>\Music”.


CLASS OVERVIEW:

   For the most part, each of the classes below contain objects of other classes in their attributes. The only class that inherits from another class is PlayerWindow() which inherits from Ui_MainWindow(). Ui_MainWindow() is the class that contains the code generated by the GUI designer which helped visualize the layout the GUI before functionality was added. Becuase of the complexity of many of the classes, each class was separated into its own file. An overview of all classes and their attributes can be seen below. Not that Ui_MainWindow() is not included in the following explanations as it was proceduraly generated with hundreds of attributes:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

   Before using this project, several libraries must be downloaded. On Windows, this requires downloading packages via pip. If you are unsure if you have pip installed or you do not have it installed, you can follow this link for instructions on how to install pip: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/. Once you have installed pip, you'll need to go into the command prompt. The command prompt can be found by typing 'cmd' into the Start Menu search bar. In the command prompt, we'll have to install the PyQt5 module using 'pip install PyQt5', the pyqtdarktheme module using 'pip install pyqtdarktheme', and the eyed3 modeul using 'pip install eyeD3' and 'pip install python-magic-bin'. If for some reason these installations do not work, check the version of Python you are using using the command prompt command 'python --version'. PyQt5 is known to have some issues with Python 3.10, so this program was developed and tested in 3.9.13, the final regular maintenance release of Python 3.9. If you are having trouble installing any of the above packages, try rolling back to Python 3.9.
   To run this program, only 'gui.py' has to be run. To do this, you can open your favorite editor or the command prompt. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where the project is stored and run the program with 'python gui.py'. This will run the program and open the application. You can use the dropdown menu in the upper left to navigate between tracks, artists, and albums. You can navigate between your music library and playlists by clicking on the Library and Playlist buttons at the top of the screen. To add a file location to your library, you can click the settings button in the upper right corner to access settings, then click on 'Add Location' and select a folder with mp3 files. A folder called "Example MP3 Files" is included in this project directory to test the functionality if you do not have any MP3 files. To play a song, you can double click it, and all the media buttons of a normal music player will appear at the bottom of the screen. When viewing all artists, double clicking on an artist will bring you to the artist page with a list of the albums by that artist. You can then double click on an album to select it and play songs with another double click. When viewing all albums, you can select an album by double clicking it and then doubling clicking the song to play. The next song in the sequence you have selected (album, playlist, etc.) will automatically play when the current song is finished.

SUGGESTED FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

   One of the next things I would suggest working on for those interested is the ability to shuffle-play playlists. This is a very common part of music players that was not implemented in this application. Allowing users to shuffle a playlist would bring more convenienve to users and elevate the functionality of the program to the next level. Another feature I would suggest working on is suggested playlists. Suggested playlists would be playlists automatically generated by the application based on the user's musical interests, mainly based around genre interests. The user would be able to select their interests in the settings menu, and the application would then automatically create playlists with the songs in the user's library that follow the user's musical interests. Unfortunately, this feature was planned, but was not able to be implemented due to time constraints and complexity of the feature.
